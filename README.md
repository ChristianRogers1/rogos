# rogos (Rogers Operating-System)
I am building a simple OS (mostly for fun). I am pulling from various tutorials to guide me, but I plan to add new (maybe even useful) unique features myself once I get the hang of it :)

If you have any recommendations for changes I should make, features I should add, or whatever, feel free to message me

This will probably take a while for me to make, so check back occasionally for updates.

#Setup
Currently, all I have is a simple bootloader that prints "Hello world!" which you could run using qemu or any other VM software

To run, type ```qemu-system-i386 -fda build/main_floppy.img``` into a CLI of your choice
(tested with WSL)
